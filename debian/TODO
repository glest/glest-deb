- make the game big endian friendly (post started on glest
  forum: http://www.glest.org/board2/viewtopic.php?t=1426)
- change configuration.xml creation method: do not symlink to
  the package one, but copy it and change it
- glest.ini should not contain references to a specific font,
  but should autodetect fonts present on the system and create
  the ugly '-*-fixed-bold-r-normal--*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*' things
  (BTW, why don't they just kill this retareded way of
  specifying fonts?)
- see what patches were added by other distros:
