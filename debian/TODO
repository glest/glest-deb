- make the game big endian friendly (post started on glest
  forum: http://www.glest.org/board2/viewtopic.php?t=1426)
- glest.ini should not contain references to a specific font,
  but should autodetect fonts present on the system and create
  the ugly '-*-fixed-bold-r-normal--*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*' things
  NOTE: If specific fonts don't exist megaglest falls back to fixed
  (BTW, why don't they just kill this retareded way of
  specifying fonts? This is planned for the next release, that is using a
  proper font library)
- see what patches were added by other distros:
- update debian/glest.6 to add information about the new options
  added for multiplayer games
