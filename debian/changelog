megaglest (3.6.0.2-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Team upload.
  * MegaGlest is not portable to non-x86 architectures, drop them
    The embedded code copy of streflop requires SSE.
  * Fix the upstream check for networking so it matches kFreeBSD
  * Disable the wx-config --prefix=/usr/local since that is the
    wrong path on Debian GNU/kFreeBSD

       anymore change it back to "english", in order to avoid the game refusing
       to start.

  [ Eddy Petrișor ]

glest (2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Eddy Petrișor ]
  * Initial official Debian release (Closes: #350391)
  * changed dependency on libxerces27-dev instead of libxerces26-dev
  * added myself to uploaders
  * Debian Games Team is maintainer
  * Added a Homepage field
  * added a clean rule to the upstream Jamfile (not as a patch since it
    brings in unnecessary complications and the rule should be always there)
  * modified the way the editor building is disabled
  * do not ignore errors during build and clean; stop on failure
  * do not run autotools during build and do not depend on automake1.9
  * nasty tricks with symlinks so that there are no unrepresentable changes in
    the source

    not big endian friendly :-(
  * added an unfinished and disabled patch for big endian support in the hope
    it will be finalized by somebody else
  * don't use utopia fonts since are not available in Debian
  * make sure that the configure script is always executable

  [ Gonéri Le Bouder ]
