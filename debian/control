Description: 3D multi-player real time strategy game
 MegaGlest is a free 3D real-time customizable strategy game
 which takes place in a context which could be compared to that of the
 pre-renaissance Europe, with the licence that magic forces exist in the
 environment and can be controlled. To play this game you must also install
 the package: megaglest-data
 .
 The current version is fully playable and supports both single player
 games against CPU controlled players and multiplayer matches over the
 Internet or a LAN.
