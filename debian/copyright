 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
 Contributor:
 .
 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or
 .
 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or
 .
 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.
 .
 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
 the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
 .
 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
 .
 No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

 License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
 permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
 .

 .
 Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
 Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
 to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
 .
 2.6. Fair Use
 .
 This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
 equivalents.
 .
 2.7. Conditions
 .
 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
 in Section 2.1.
 .
 3. Responsibilities
 -------------------
 .
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 .
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 .
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 .
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 .
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 .
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).
 .
 3.4. Notices
 .
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 .
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 .
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
 --------------
 .
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 Your receipt of the notice.
 .
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
 .
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .

 *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"        *
 *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or   *
 *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
 *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
 *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
 *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
 *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
 *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
 *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
 *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
 *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
 *                                                                      *

 *  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *

 *  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
 *  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
 *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
 *  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
 *  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
 *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
 *  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *
 *  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *
 *  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *
 *  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *
 *  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *
 *  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
 *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
 *  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
 *   limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
 *                                                                       *

 Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
 cross-claims or counter-claims.
 .
 9. Miscellaneous
 ----------------
 .
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
