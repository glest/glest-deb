.SH CONFIGURATION
.TP
.B Glest can be configured in three ways:
.br
- in-game config menu: basic parameters
.br
- configuration tool: advanced parameters
.br
- glest.ini: all parameters

.SH VIDEO CARD HINTS
.TP
.B Auto config.
.br
The first time you run the game it will try to detect the graphic settings most
suitable for your video card. It's highly recommended that you don't change them
unless you really know what you are doing. If you change the settings and you
want to reset to the recommended ones, you can do it by using the auto config
button in the in-game config menu.
.TP
.B Required card features.
.br
The game requires either OpenGL 1.4 or OpenGL 1.3 plus the GL_ARB_env_crossbar
extesion. Most video cards with recent drivers support this features. You can
bypass the feature check by replacing the "CheckGlCaps=1" line in glest.ini by
"CheckGlCaps=0", but the game may crash or have graphics errors.
.TP
.B ATI card problems.
.br
It seems to be bug in some ATI OpenGL drivers that makes the game crash with
certain card/driver configurations when using more than 1 light. Auto config  will
detect this issue and turn off all secondary lights when it detects an ATI card.
If you still want to try running the game using more than 1 light you can change
this setting in the in-game config menu.
.TP
.B Shadows.
.br
The game features real-time shadows using different algorithms. 1) Projected: Fast
shadows but they provide unit over terrain shadows only, and can produce incorrect
shadows in some circumstances. 2) Shadow mapping: Slow shadows but they are
always correct and provide everything over everything shadows. In ATI cards they
look aliased. Both types of shadows require a video card with 3 texture unit
support. Auto config will set the most suitable shadow mode for your video card.
.TP
.B 3D textures
.br
The game uses 3D textures for some effects like animated water. Some old video cards
(ie: GeForceMX) don't support this feature by hardware and the game runs really
slow when the camera is near a river.  Auto config will detect this and disable
3D textures when needed.
